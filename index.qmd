Hi, I'm Jonas. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at the
[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in the 
[CaRAML](https://caraml-group.github.io/) group under the supervision of
[Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

My research interests are broadly in the fields of Explainability and Graph Neural
Networks (independently as well as in combination).
However, the underlying motivation of understanding how machine learning models work
stretches pretty much across all fields, so feel free to
[reach out](mailto:jj570@cl.cam.ac.uk) about anything that interests you.

Prior to this, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Cambridge Consultants](https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/) and received an MPhil in
Advanced Computer Science from Cambridge as well as a BSc in Informatics from the
[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/).
