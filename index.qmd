Hi, I'm Jonas. I'm originally from Germany where I received my BSc in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) before coming to the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) to pursue the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science under the supervision of [Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). 

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cambridge Consultants](https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/). 
My research interests are broadly in the fields of Explainability and Graph Neural Networks (independently as well as in combination). 
However, the underlying motivation of understanding how machine learning models work stretches pretty much across all fields, so feel free to [reach out](mailto:jj570@cantab.ac.uk) about anything that interests you.
