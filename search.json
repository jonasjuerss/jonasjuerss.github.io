    "text": "Hi, I’m Jonas. I’m originally from Germany where I received my BSc in Informatics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) before coming to the University of Cambridge to pursue the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science under the supervision of Pietro Liò.\nCurrently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Cambridge Consultants. My research interests are broadly in the fields of Explainability and Graph Neural Networks (independently as well as in combination). However, the underlying motivation of understanding how machine learning models work stretches pretty much across all fields, so feel free to reach out (jj570 at cantab dot ac dot uk) about anything that interests you."
